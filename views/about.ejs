                    <h3>Welcome to QUIFACT</h3>
                    <p>1.	A Seller uploads the invoice issued to him/her on the platform after completing the contractual agreement with the Buyer/Corporate <br>
                        2.	It then goes to the Buyer for acceptance. Once the buyer accepts/acknowledge to know/issue the invoice to the seller, the invoice becomes a factoring unit and gets cleared for auctioning <br>
                        3.	The factoring unit then goes to auction/bidding page where it will now be visible to the Financiers on the platform. <br>
                        4.	The Financiers (who will appear as anonymous to the Buyers and Sellers) then enter their discounting rate/bid price for the invoice listed. <br>
                        5.	The Seller then has the liberty to choose from the list the preferred bidder for the invoice (usually the lowest bidder in terms of discount rate wins). <br>
                        6.	Quifact then settles the trade by debiting the Financier and paying the Seller (all within 24 hours). The Financier is expected to have fund their account with Quifactâ€™s receiving agent which will be a local commercial bank in Nigeria. <br>
                        7.	The second leg of the settlement is when the Buyer/Corporate makes the repayment and the amount is repaid to the financier. <br>
